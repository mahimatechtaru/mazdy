                Medical accommodation at home refers to the support, permission, and adjustments provided to an
                individual so they can recover or manage health conditions while staying at home.
                This type of accommodation is essential for people who are facing temporary or long-term medical
                challenges.
                Home-based medical accommodation helps ensure safety, comfort, and proper healing without the physical
                stress of travel or workplace demands.
                It also provides emotional relief and promotes faster recovery.</p>
